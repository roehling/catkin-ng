hazel_export
============

Declare exports for usage in other packages.

.. code-block:: cmake

    hazel_export(
        [CMAKE_SCRIPTS <script> ...]
        [EXPORT <export>]
        [FILE <file>]
        [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
        [TARGETS <target> ...]
    )

The ``hazel_export()`` command makes functionality of your package available
for other packages. It can export target sets, CMake scripts, and will assist
in the dependency resolution for the :cmake:command:`hazel_package` command.

The following options are available:

``CMAKE_SCRIPTS``

    Export custom CMake configuration scripts. Each named script is installed
    with the package, and a corresponding :cmake:command:`include` command is
    added to the main configuration script. Relative paths are assumed to be
    relative to :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.

    Hazel will automatically invoke certain preprocessors if the corresponding
    templates are found. The ``.cmake`` suffix, if any, will be stripped from
    ``<script>``. Then:

    * If ``<script>.cmake`` exists, it is installed verbatim.

    * If ``<script>.cmake.in`` exists, the :cmake:command:`configure_file`
      command is invoked (with ``@ONLY``) to create ``<script>.cmake``.

    * If ``<script>.cmake.em`` exists, the Empy preprocessor is invoked to
      create ``<script>.cmake``.
    
    * If ``<script>.cmake.installspace.em`` and/or
      ``<script>.cmake.develspace.em`` exist, the Empy preprocessor is invoked
      to create separate ``<script>.cmake`` versions for installation and the
      local develspace.

    The Empy preprocessor is provided with the following predefined variables:

    * ``DEVELSPACE`` and ``INSTALLSPACE`` are set to ``True`` or ``False``
      depending on the location where the preprocessed file ends up.
    
    * ``PREFIX`` is set to either :cmake:variable:`HAZEL_DEVEL_PREFIX` or
      :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
    
    * ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``, ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``,
      ``PROJECT_NAME``, ``PROJECT_VERSION``, ``PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR``, and
      ``PROJECT_BINARY_DIR`` are set to the corresponding CMake variables.

    * ``HAZEL_GLOBAL_<type>DIR`` and
      ``HAZEL_PACKAGE_<type>DIR`` are set to absolute paths of various
      install locations. ``<type>`` can be one of ``BIN``,
      ``ETC``, ``INCLUDE``, ``LIB``, ``LIBEXEC``, ``PYTHON``, ``OBJECTS``,
      or ``SHARE``.

``EXPORT``

    Export a target set. You can add targets to the set with the ``TARGETS``
    option, or with

    .. code-block:: cmake

        install(TARGETS ... EXPORT <export>)

``FILE``

    Override the file name for the exported target set. If omitted, it will
    default to ``<export>.cmake``.

``NAMESPACE``

    Prefix all exported targets with ``<namespace>``. If omitted, it will
    default to ``${PROJECT_NAME}::``.

``TARGETS``

    Add targets to the export set. If the ``EXPORT`` option is omitted, an
    implicit ``EXPORT ${PROJECT_NAME}Targets`` is assumed. The targets will
    also automatically be installed to the proper locations.

    The ``TARGETS`` option is the recommended way to export targets, because it
    provides Hazel with an opportunity to scan the targets for known external
    dependencies and implicitly add them to the ``DEPENDS`` option of the
    :cmake:command:`hazel_package` command.
