hazel_python_setup
==================

Install Python modules.

.. code-block:: cmake

    hazel_python_setup(
        [GLOBAL]
        [SRCDIR <srcdir>]
    )

The ``hazel_python_setup()`` command ensures that the ``setup.py`` of a wrapped
Python package is invoked at build time and installs to the correct locations.

When the ``GLOBAL`` option is given, Python scripts will be installed to the
global ``<prefix>/bin`` directory. By default, Python scripts will be installed
to the package-specific ``<prefix>/lib/<package>`` directory, where they can be
found by ``rosrun`` or ``ros2 run``.

You should avoid polluting the global namespace with scripts unless they are
independently useful and not specific to your package. Also, their name should
not collide with system binaries.

The ``SRCDIR`` option specifies the source location of ``setup.py`` if it is
not in the same location as the ``CMakeLists.txt`` that calls
``hazel_python_setup()``. Relative paths are interpreted relative to
:cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.

Hazel provides a setuptools wrapper to automatically add metadata from the
``package.xml`` to the Python package manifest. Assuming that the sources for
your Python packages are in the ``src`` subdirectory, a minimal working
``setup.py`` would be:

.. code-block:: python

    from hazel.setup import setup

    setup(
        package_dir={"": "src"}
    )

Hazel also supports ``setup.cfg`` configuration files. However, Hazel does not
support `PEP 517`_ style builds, i.e., packages without ``setup.py``.
