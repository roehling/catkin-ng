hazel_package
=============

Create the CMake configuration files for the Hazel package.

.. code-block:: cmake

    hazel_package(
        [COMPATIBILITY <compat>]
        [CMAKE_SCRIPTS <script> ...]
        [DEPENDS <depend> ...]
        [EXPORT <export>]
        [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
        [STRICT_VERSIONING]
        [TARGETS <target> ...]
    )

The ``hazel_package()`` command should be the final Hazel command in the
``CMakeLists.txt`` and finalizes the package configuration. For convenience,
``hazel_package()`` also accepts most options for the :cmake:command:`hazel_export`
command and will invoke it implicitly if required.

The following options are available:

``COMPATIBILITY``

    This option determines which requested package versions will be considered
    compatible by :cmake:command:`find_package`. The compatibility mode is used
    internally as argument for
    :cmake:command:`write_basic_package_version_file` and may take one of the
    following values:

    * ``AnyNewerVersion`` means that the installed package version will be
      considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the same as the
      requested version. This mode should be used for packages which are
      fully backwards compatible, even across major versions.
    * ``SameMajorVersion`` means that the major version must be the same as
      requested, e.g. version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if
      version 1.0 is requested.
    * ``SameMinorVersion`` means that both major and minor version must be
      the same as requested, e.g. version 0.2 will not be compatiblle if
      0.1 is requested.
    * ``ExactVersion`` means that the package is only considered compatible
      if the requested version matches exactly the installed version.
    
    If the ``COMPATIBILITY`` option is not given, ``ExactVersion`` is assumed.

``CMAKE_SCRIPTS``

    Install additional custom CMake configuration scripts. For details, see the
    documentation of the :cmake:command:`hazel_export` command.

``DEPENDS``

    Declare package dependencies. If you want to export a target for other
    packages, you also need to export the public dependencies of your target.
    That means if you used :cmake:command:`find_package` to find a public
    dependency, you need to tell everyone who use your package to call
    :cmake:command:`find_package` for that dependency, too.
    
    If you use the ``TARGETS`` option to export your targets, Hazel will assist
    you and automatically depend on other Hazel packages or any target you
    imported using the :cmake:command:`hazel_import` command if they are needed
    by your exported targets.

    You need to declare package dependencies manually if you use targets from a
    non-Hazel package, or if you compose your export set with
    :cmake:command:`install(TARGETS)` and do not use the ``TARGETS``
    option.

    The ``DEPENDS`` option accepts a list of all packages which need to be
    found and their targets imported for your exported targets to work. You can
    also request a particular version and/or package components just as you
    would with the :cmake:command:`find_package` command, e.g. ``"Boost 1.70
    COMPONENTS system"``. In that case, you must also use quotes to protect the
    whitespaces in the dependency string.

    Multiple depends on the same package are allowed and will be combined.
    Contradicting dependencies such as ``"Boost 1.60 EXACT"`` and ``"Boost 1.70
    EXACT"`` are not allowed and, if not detected by Hazel at build time, will
    render your package unusable.

``EXPORT``

    Export package targets from the export set ``<export>``. For details, see
    the documentation of the :cmake:command:`hazel_export` command.

``NAMESPACE``

    Prefix exported targets with ``<namespace>``. For details, see the
    documentation of the :cmake:command:`hazel_export` command.

``TARGETS``

    Add targets to the export set. For details, see the documentation of the
    :cmake:command:`hazel_export` command.
