Hazel test packages
===================

These are a few example packages to exercise the Hazel functionality.
Run `build-test-packages.sh` to create and build a temporary workspace
from these packages. The workspace will be removed afterwards.

If you want to keep the workspace to inspect it, set the environment variable
`KEEP_WS=1` first. The workspace will be located in `/tmp/hazel_ws`.
